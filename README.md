# Bio-Data-Builder
OOP Final Project

BioData

Overview
BioData Builder is a simple yet powerful desktop application designed to help users quickly create professional bio data documents. Instead of manually designing a bio data from scratch, users can fill out their details in a professionally styled interface, and the app instantly generates a ready-to-print PDF file, saving time and effort. This project showcases Java OOP principles, GUI design with professional styling, and PDF generation. It is designed for individual use but can be extended for organizations or agencies in the future.
